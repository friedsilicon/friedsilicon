# Fried Silicon

Engineering-first tools for developers who care about **speed**, **schemas**, and **local-first software**.

We build **SilicaDB** — a local-first data engine for AI-native apps — and a small family of tools and experiments around structured data and performance.

## What I’m working on

### [SilicaDB →](/silicadb/)

A single-file data engine that combines:

- Structured data (tables, documents, events)
- Vectors and embeddings
- Schema registry (SODL)
- Semantic search
- Optional sync

All in one portable file you embed directly into your app.

## Writing

I also write about technology, product, AI, and whatever I’m experimenting with.

## About

I’m Shivanand (“Shiva”), a principal PM / systems nerd living in North Vancouver.  
I like local-first software, compilers, golf, and building unnecessarily ambitious tools.
