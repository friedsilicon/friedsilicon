## 🎉 Thank You for Becoming a Founding User!

Your pre-order for **SilicaDB PRO ($29)** is confirmed.

You’re now officially a **Founding User** — thank you for supporting this project early. Your support directly helps validate that a local-first AI data engine is something developers actually want.

## What happens next?

Over the coming weeks you’ll receive:

- Early access builds as soon as they’re ready  
- Updates on SilicaDB’s development progress  
- A short onboarding note asking about your use case  
- An invite to the private feedback channel  
- A spot (optional) on the **Founding Users** acknowledgments page  

I’ll only email when I have something real to show — no noise.

## Want to share your use case now?

It helps shape the roadmap:

## Stay tuned

SilicaDB is being built in the open at **Fried Silicon**.  
Thank you again for supporting something ambitious, local-first, and developer-friendly.

If anything is wrong with your order, or you need a refund at any time, just email me.
